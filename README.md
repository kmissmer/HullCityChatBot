# Hull City Chatbot Enhancement Roadmap

## Current Features
- Basic chat functionality with Hull City themed responses
- Memory management using InMemoryChatMessageHistory
- Session management to handle multiple conversations
- Clear history command
- New session command

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Streaming Responses
Create a more responsive user experience by streaming the bot's reply as it's generated.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Learn about the `.stream()` method in LangChain
- Modify your chat function to use streaming
- Update the terminal interface to display text progressively
- Add a progress indicator while waiting for responses

### 2. Error Handling and Retries
Make your chatbot more resilient against API failures and connection issues.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a wrapper function that includes try/except blocks
- Implement a retry counter with appropriate backoff strategy
- Add informative error messages for different failure types
- Log errors for future debugging

### 3. Conversation Management
Add the ability to save and load conversations.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create methods to serialize conversation history to JSON
- Implement a file naming convention for saved conversations
- Add commands to the interface for save/load operations
- Include timestamp and metadata in saved conversations

### 4. Model Parameter Controls
Allow users to customize the bot's response style.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Add commands to adjust temperature (creativity)
- Create functions to modify max token length
- Implement presets for different conversation styles
- Add command to reset to default settings

### 5. Conversation Summarization
Help users keep track of lengthy conversations.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a summarization prompt template
- Implement a function to extract key points from history

- Consider auto-summarizing after certain thresholds

### 6. Persistent Storage
Move from in-memory to database storage for long-term persistence.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Choose a database backend (SQLite for simplicity)
- Set up necessary database tables for message storage
- Update the history retrieval function to use the database

- Create a document processing pipeline
- Implement vector embeddings for semantic search
- Integrate retrieval into the conversation flow
